# Calender Application
A calender for returned missionaries similar to the Preach my Gospel application. Lets returned missionaries more easily readjust to post mission life. Includes features such as goal setting, homework scheduling, and group events. Potentially chat rooms or ways to reach out and talk with other missionaries in the same situation.

Project timeline:
3/19 - Calender with local events
3/26 - Calender connected with database
4/2 - UI fully functional
4/9 - Add goal-setting options
4/16 - Have the homework / school section functional.
Depending on time, add group events / interaction with other users.
